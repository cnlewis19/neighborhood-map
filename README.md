## Instructions
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses React, the Google Maps API, Google Maps React, Material UI, the Foursquare API and Font Awesome. This project gives a map of gluten free restaurants in the Buffalo, NY area.

In order to run the application, run npm install and npm start on the project folder.

There is service worker capability in the project, however it is only accessible in the production build.

## Acknowledgements
The Udacity lessons and React documentation were extremely helpful in building this project, as well as the previously mentioned dependencies. In addition to these sources, both [Doug Brown's Project 7 Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVAVLCJwAAo&feature=youtu.be) and Scotch's article [React Apps with Google Maps and google-maps-react](https://scotch.io/tutorials/react-apps-with-the-google-maps-api-and-google-maps-react) were essential in the final completion of this project.
